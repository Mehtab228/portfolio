      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mehtab Riar. Before I switched over to software development, I worked as a project manager and a researcher. The skills and tools I learned in project management and research are very transferable to software development, both of which require unique problem solving and a level of sociability. Software development is not necessarily a pivot away from those fields, rather it builds on top of them. Tech is prevalent in every aspect of our lives and it will continue to integrate itself into these professions to add functionality we didnâ€™t think was possible. I chose to transition into software development because I loved the creative problem solving aspect of it as there can be a multitude of solutions to the same problem and the social environment coding takes place in. With my new found knowledge I hope to work with talented individuals in tackling some of the worlds most pressing problems such as climate change!",

I created a collision system where pieces would stop once they collide or reach the bottom of the game space.",
